  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Ruletomodifycustody
continue button field: ruletomodifycustody_intro
question: |
  What is Needed
subquestion: |
  What is needed to change custody depends on how the previous custody order was decided. Judgments are decided in two ways:

  1. by the parties' agreement or consent (settlement).
  2. by the judge after a contradictory hearing (trial).

  If you aren't sure how the previous judgment was decided, read the Custody Judgment carefully to find out.

question: |
  Sorry, you cannot proceed with this interview.
subquestion: |
  Since your custody judgment has not been registered with a Louisiana court, you will need to use this [Form Letter to Register Foreign or Out-of-State Custody Order](https://www.lasc.org/rules/dist.ct/Title_IV/APPENDIX_29.5.pdf). For this form, you will need: 
  
  1. a letter or other document requesting registration of the custody order
  2. two (2) copies, including one (1) certified copy, of the custody order
  3. a notarized statement that to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person seeking registration, the order has not been modified
  4. the name and address of the person seeking registration and any parent or person acting as a parent who has been awarded custody or visitation in the custody order requested to be registered. (Not necessary in cases of emergency jurisdiction)
  
  After these documents are collected, deliver them by mail or by hand to the appropriate state court.
